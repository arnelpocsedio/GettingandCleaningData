In this repository you will find:

1. __CodeBook.md__ which describes the variables and data, including data processing conducted

2.  __run_analysis.R__ which is the script used to download (i.e. __GETTING__), merge, label, filter and summarize, that is getting the mean, (i.e. __CLEANING__) the data

3. __Tidy_Data.txt__ is the output from run_analysis.R which is a tidy dataset that can be used for analysis. To load the dataset, you can use the read.table() function in R.
